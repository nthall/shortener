CSS & TEMPLATES:
- make result page look more like socuteURL's
  - include easy clipboard copy
- both pages need a little bottom menu w/ a short about page, i guess
- link to the blog once it exists

VIEWS/MODELS:
- for bonus points, create a new model that tracks http referrer for each hit that a shortcode gets, or figure out a way to tie it in to GA, or both.

SOMEDAY:
- bookmarklet
