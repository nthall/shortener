- Index
    just needs to be prettified i guess.
- Result
#   build app logic:
#       first, check for a destination url in the db 
#       if it exists, result = the already-existing Zomburl
#       if not, create it.
#           creating a Zomburl:
#               generate a pattern
#                   check that it's not already in use
#                   repeat until you make one that doesn't already exist.
#                   once you have that, store it!
    build template for result page
        modeled loosely on socuteurl, bitly, etc
- Redirect
    when someone attempts to visit a shortened url, get the destination url and redirect them.
        - DON'T FORGET: update stats for that Zomburl (hits & last_accessed)
    if it doesn't exist, rather than throwing a 404, give a custom error message that links them to the index.
